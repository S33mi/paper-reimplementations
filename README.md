# Paper Reimplementations & Reproductions



My personal reproductions and reimplementations of research papers in Python/Jupyter notebooks.  

Focus: ML, data analysis, optimization, anomaly detection, and EDA tools.



## Current Entries

- **DataPrep.EDA (2021)** — Reimplementing core task-centric EDA features from the SIGMOD 2021 paper "DataPrep.EDA: Task-Centric Exploratory Data Analysis for Statistical Modeling in Python"  

  → [dataprep_eda_reimplementation.ipynb](notebooks/dataprep_eda_reimplementation.ipynb)  

  Goal: Build simplified versions of auto-EDA functions (overview stats, distributions, correlations, missing values) without using the original library.



More notebooks coming soon!



## Setup

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook
